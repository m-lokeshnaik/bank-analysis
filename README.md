#Banking Risk Analytics & Financial Loss Minimization Project
Project Description
Developed an end-to-end data analytics solution for banking risk management, leveraging MySQL for data management and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on client attributes. Designed and built an interactive risk analytics dashboard in Power BI with Canva backgrounds, providing actionable insights to mitigate financial loss and support data-driven decision-making.

Features
Data Acquisition & Storage: Efficiently managed banking client data.

Comprehensive EDA: Explored client demographics, financial behaviors, and identified key correlations.

Feature Engineering: Created new derived attributes like 'income band'.

Interactive Dashboard: A multi-page Power BI dashboard for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends.

Dynamic Filtering: Slicers for filtering data by gender, year of joining, and banking relationship.

Risk Identification: Supports the identification of potential lending risks and areas of financial exposure.

Technologies Used
Database: MySQL

Data Analysis & Manipulation: Python (Pandas)

Data Visualization (Python): Matplotlib, Seaborn

Business Intelligence & Dashboarding: Power BI

Design Tool: Canva (for dashboard aesthetics)

Project Workflow
The project followed a structured data analytics lifecycle:

Data Acquisition: Obtained a banking client dataset.

Data Preparation: Converted raw data to CSV and loaded it into a MySQL database.

Data Connection: Established a connection between Python and the MySQL database to retrieve data into a Pandas DataFrame.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Inspected data shape and information (.info(), .describe()).

Analyzed categorical data using value_counts() and visualizations.

Engineered 'income band' feature.

Analyzed numerical data distributions using histograms.

Identified correlations using heatmaps.

Dashboard Design: Planned and designed the multi-page dashboard layout in Canva.

Power BI Dashboard Development:

Connected Power BI to the MySQL database.

Created key metric cards (Total Clients, Total Loans, Total Deposits, etc.).

Implemented interactive slicers for dynamic filtering.

Developed various visualizations (e.g., donut charts for loan distribution).

Configured page navigation for a seamless user experience.

How to Run/Setup (Conceptual)
To replicate this project, you would typically:

Database Setup:

Install MySQL.

Create a database (e.g., bankingcase).

Import the banking client dataset into a table within the database.

Python Environment:

Set up a Python environment (e.g., using Anaconda or venv).

Install necessary libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, mysql-connector-python.

Run the Python script/Jupyter Notebook to perform EDA and generate insights.

Power BI Dashboard:

Install Power BI Desktop.

Connect Power BI to your MySQL database instance.

Recreate the dashboard visualizations and slicers based on the project's design.

Import any custom background images designed in Canva.

(Note: Specific data files and detailed code are not provided in this README, as this is a conceptual outline based on a project demonstration.)

Insights & Results
The project delivered an interactive dashboard that provides:

A clear overview of the client base and their financial relationships.

Insights into loan and deposit distributions across different client segments (e.g., income bands, gender, banking relationships).

Identification of strong correlations between various financial accounts, aiding in understanding client financial behavior.

A tool for stakeholders to quickly filter and analyze data, supporting proactive risk assessment and strategic decision-making to minimize potential financial losses from lending activities.

Future Enhancements
Integrate more advanced machine learning models for predictive risk scoring.

Incorporate real-time data updates for more current insights.

Expand the dashboard with additional financial product analysis.

Implement user access controls for different stakeholder roles.
